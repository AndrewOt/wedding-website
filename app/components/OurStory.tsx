    <p>
      We met at church in the singles' ministry. We met early last year, but
      didn't get to know each other until the summer when we both attended a
      social gathering in the park. During that conversation, we learned that
      both of our parents attended college together. At the time, we didn't
      think they would know each other. Turns out, they were friends! Andrew's
      parents happened to be heading through KC soon after this realization, and
      they suggested getting ice cream with my parents as a little college
      reunion. Andrew and I tagged along and it was a ton of fun! Andrew and I
      like to refer to this as our "not-date-with-our-parents". After that we
      texted back and forth playing telephone for our parents before finally
      getting them connected with each other. Andrew and I continued to text for
      the next week until one evening he asked if I might like a walking buddy
      (I really like walks). I said yes and now we're gettin' hitched!

      April 1st is Lydia's birthday. We made plans for Lydia's parents to come
      over lunch time to celebrate. Lydia also mentioned she wanted to watch the
      sunrise in the park where we got to know each other and had our first
      date. So, on the 1st, a Saturday, we got to the park at 7am in 26 degree
      weather. Little did she know, I had a ring in my pocket! I had intentions
      to get on one knee as we were packing up, but it was very cold, so I went
      for it... and she said yes!!

      Afterwards, we went to a brunch place where it was warm. Then we went to
      her aunt and uncle's house for her birthday party turned engagement party.
      In addition to her family from Topeka, I invited friends from church and
      her sister who is in school in Kentucky (a 7 hour drive). Then my parents
      surprised me by driving up from Arkansas. Overall, it was a very blessed
      and wonderful day! The Lord has been very kind to us in our relationship.
