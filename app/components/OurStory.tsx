        Lydia and Andrew met at church in the singles' ministry. They met early 2022, but
        didn't get to know each other until the summer when they both attended a
        social gathering in the park. During that conversation, they learned that
        both of their parents attended college together. At the time, they didn't
        think they would know each other. Turns out, they were friends! Andrew's
        parents happened to be heading through KC soon after this realization, and
        they suggested getting ice cream with Lydia's parents as a little college
        reunion. Andrew and Lydia tagged along and it was a ton of fun! They
        like to refer to this as the "not-date-with-our-parents". After that they
        texted back and forth playing telephone for their parents before finally
        getting them connected with each other. They continued to text for
        the next week until one evening Andrew asked if Lydia might like a walking buddy
        (she really like walks). She said yes and now they are getting married!

        April 1st is Lydia's birthday. They made plans for Lydia's parents to come
        over lunch time to celebrate. Lydia also mentioned she wanted to watch the
        sunrise in the park where we got to know each other and had their first
        date. So, on the 1st, a Saturday, we got to the park at 7am in 26 degree
        weather. Little did she know, Andrew had a ring in his pocket! He had intentions
        to get on one knee as they were packing up, but it was very cold, so he went
        for it... and she said yes!! It was a very blessed and wonderful day! The
        Lord has been very kind to us in our relationship and we can't wait to celebrate with you!
